Basic idea:
1.Heap sort is a sort algorithm designed by using the data structure of heap. Heap sort is a sort of choice. Its worst, best and average time complexity are O (nlogn), and it is also unstable sort.
2.The 2 heap is a complete binary tree with the following properties: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its left and right child nodes. This situation is called the big top heap. Note: there is no relationship between the value of the left child and the value of the right child of the node.
3.The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its left and right child nodes, which is called small top heap.

We can treat leaf nodes as heaps, add non-leaf nodes on the basis of leaf nodes, and adjust them. The process is the same as adjusting the heap.
1  Note here that the array subscripts start from 0, so the left and right sub-node subscripts of node (i) are 2 * i+1, 2 * i+2 respectively. And the subscript of the first non-leaf node islen/2-1.
2  Adjust the heap: after the original number has formed the heap, exchange the position between the top element A [0] and the last element A [n-1] in the heap, and then adjust A [0,1,2.... N-2] to the maximum heap
3  Repeat the second step until there is only one element left. At this time, A [0,1,2... n-1] is an array sorted from small to large, and does not occupy additional space
